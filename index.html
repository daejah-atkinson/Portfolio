      <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> Over the past couple of years, I've become more interested web development as I highly enjoy creative problem solving and I'd love to work in a career where I'm continuing to learn and grow as the field of technology evolves. </p>
        <p> Outside of web development I enjoy taking my German Shepherd Riley to the park to play fetch. I also enjoy going to yoga classes and going on hikes. </p>

        <p> If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! </p>
